# CT619-Week1

1. To get started, install the Eclipse Java IDE (freely available from [Eclipse](eclipse.org)). Type in and run a sample Java program. (Not for credit; this is just to give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the workings of Eclipse, as it's quite different from development environments for other languages you may have encountered before.) 
2. Write a Java program for calculating the area of triangles and rectangles. The user is asked whether a triangle or rectangle is required, then prompted for the relevant dimensions, and the answer is displayed. Use the Wages program as a template. Note that the area of a rectangle is width \* height, and the area of a triangle is Â½ base width \* height. Ensure your program works correctly for different user inputs.
3. Write a short report (300-500 words) on experimenting with the Debugger. Follow the introduction given in Workshop 1, Section 2 and address each of the questions below:
    - a. Insert a breakpoint at the line after where you ask the user whether a triangle or rectangle is required. How can you then step along the program line by line?
    - b. What happens with the flow of control when you reach the if statement?
    - c. Observe the values of variables in the Variables window. Are all variables always shown? When do they change?
    - d. Add two bugs to your program (one in the logic of the if statement and another in one of the calculations) and describe how you might track them down with the Debugger.
    - e. How many times do you have to run the program to be satisfied that no bugs remain? Explain.
